I made this application as a self imposed challenge to test my knowledge of Java, JavaFX and some SQL queries.
The project is made to be an application with a database of people with all the basic funcitonalities and some extra on top.

## Development:

I used Scene Builder to add some frontend components and I then started to make the functionality bit by bit.
This project was the first time I had used SQL queries in a significant way, so this came with a lot of learning.
At that point I barely knew anything about OOP so it took a while to optimize the main functionalities of this project.
After being done with the main functionality(that being Create, Read, Update and Delete or more widely known CRUD), 
the hurdles came with the validation of the inputs. That was initially the most difficult challenge but a buch of time 
dedicated to learning about regex, and its usage solved mostly solved my problems. To make the user experience smoother,
some time needed to be dedicated to learning the Scene Builder that I used for the frontend inside and out, and I added 
many quality of life changes. I realized that many people will not have the database set up for the exact purposes of
the project so I made a file with a template for everything needed for ease of access to the application. Then I wanted
to make it even easier to use and I added support for local databases using SQLite. Then when I had everything working I
decided to learn a bunch more concepts of application building, and specific to desktop environments I made key 
combinations(for reference there is a picture below). After that I wanted to make the application multilanguage supported,
so I added support for Bulgarian and English languages using resource bundles. Learning about jlink then allowed me to add 
support for both Windows and Linux.
