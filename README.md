I made this application as a self imposed challenge to test my knowledge of Java, JavaFX and easy SQL queries.
The project is made to be an application with a database of people with all the basic funcitonalities and some extra on top.

The project uses:

JavaFX - 13

OpenJDK - 12

SQLite - for local based databese

MariaDB - 10.3.27

Gradle - 6.7

Netbeans

Scene Builder

Linux/Windows build with integrated java and other libraries with jlink

How to get started with the application is explained in more datail in the readme file inside the project intself.
Here is a showcase of the main functionalities:
