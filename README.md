I made this application as a self imposed challenge to test my knowledge of Java, JavaFX and easy SQL queries.
The project is made to be an application with a database of people with all the basic funcitonalities and some extra on top.

The project uses:
JavaFX - 13
OpenJDK - 12
SQLite - for local based databese
MariaDB - 10.3.27
Gradle - 6.7
Netbeans
Scene Builder

Linux/Windows build with integrated java and other libraries with jlink

Getting started with the application is explained in more datail in the readme file inside the project intself.
