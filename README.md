I made this application as a self imposed challenge to test my knowledge of Java, JavaFX and easy SQL queries.
The project is made to be an application with a database of people with all the basic funcitonalities and some extra on top.

I used Scene Builder to add some frontend components and I then started to make the functionality bit by bit.
This project was the first time I had used SQL queries in a significant way, so this came with a lot of learning.
At that point I barely knew anything about OOP so it took a while to optimize the main functionalities of this project.
The hurdles came with the validation of the inputs. That was initially the most difficult challenge but a buch of time 
dedicated to learning about regex, and its usage solved mostly solved my problems. To make the user experience smoother,
some time needed to be dedicated to learning the Scene Builder that I used for the frontend inside and out, and I added 
many quality of life changes. 

The project uses:

JavaFX - 13

OpenJDK - 12

SQLite - for local based databese

MariaDB - 10.3.27

Gradle - 6.7

Netbeans

Scene Builder

Linux/Windows build with integrated java and other libraries with jlink

How to get started with the application is explained in more datail in the readme file inside the project intself.
Here is a showcase of the main functionalities:
